**Step 1**

Back up your files, in case this goes horribly wrong.

**Step 2**

Move the top level directory to your Desktop. Once finished, your folder structure should look like this:

`++ Desktop`

`++++ Top_Level_Folder`

`++++++ Sub_Folder_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_3`

`++++++ Sub_Folder_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_3`

`++++++ Sub_Folder_4`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_3`

`.`
`.`
`.`

`++++++ Sub_Folder_100`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_3`


**Step 3**

Move the file named _rename_frankies_filez.sh_ into the top level directory.

`++ Desktop`

`++++ Top_Level_Folder`   <-- Move _rename_frankies_filez.sh_ into this directory.

`++++++ Sub_Folder_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_3`

`++++++ Sub_Folder_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_3`

`++++++ Sub_Folder_4`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_3`

`.`
`.`
`.`

`++++++ Sub_Folder_100`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_1`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_2`
`++++++++ Loan_Pic_3`




**Step 3**

Open a Terminal window (Finder -> Go -> Utilities -> Terminal).



**Step 4**


Navigate to the top level directory in the Terminal window (Note: replace 'Top_Level_Folder' with whatever your top-level directory is called).

`cd Desktop/Top_Level_Folder`


**Step 5**

Run the command in the Terminal window.

`./_rename_frankies_filez.sh`
